      "summary": "This project is a multimodal RAG application that lets users chat with YouTube videos. By combining video transcription, visual understanding, and retrieval-augmented generation, it enables natural language conversations grounded in the content of a video. Users can ask questions, request summaries, or jump to specific moments without manually scrubbing through timelines. The interface is built with Gradio, providing an intuitive and interactive way to explore video knowledge.",
